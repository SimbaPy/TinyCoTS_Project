# TinyCoTS_Project
TinyCo is a fictional sales company that sells various SKUs across it's five. I take on a role of a business analyst hired in the Supply Chain Department to make sense of the data the stores generate, extract valuable insights and ultimately predict demand for the stores' profits.

This project is meant toshowcase my skills in the following areas as a data scientist:
 - Python programming,
 - Data importing, wrangling/cleaning and transformation,
 - Data visualisation,
 - Jupyter notebooks and
 - Time series analysis, modelling and forecasting.

The project is divided into 3 section: Data Cleaning, Data Exploration and Time Series Analysis. Each section is within its own Jupyter notebook for readability sake.

Please feel free to explore this data, scrutinise it and suggest any improvements I could make to the project.
